# Why Rust?

Some unique selling points of Rust:

* Compile time memory safety.
* Lack of undefined runtime behavior.
* Modern language features.

Key points to highlight for students with C and Python experience:

* Coming from C: Rust eliminates a whole class of _runtime errors_
  via the borrow checker. You get performance like in C, but you don't
  have the memory unsafety issues. In addition, you get a modern language with
  constructs like pattern matching and built-in dependency management.

* Coming from Python: You get similar memory safety as in Python, plus a similar
  high-level language feeling with iterators, pattern matching, and expressive syntax.
  In addition you get fast and predictable performance like C (no garbage collector)
  as well as access to low-level hardware (should you need it)
