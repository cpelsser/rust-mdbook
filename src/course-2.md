# Welcome to course 2

We will cover:

* Variables: type inference, `Option`, `static` and `const`, scopes and
  shadowing.

* Memory management: stack vs heap, manual memory management, scope-based memory
  management, and garbage collection.

* Ownership: move semantics, copying and cloning, borrowing, and lifetimes.
