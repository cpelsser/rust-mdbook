# Welcome to course 5

In this course, we will cover some more advanced topics of Rust:

* Traits: deriving traits, default methods, and important standard library
  traits.

* Generics: generic data types, generic methods, trait bounds, `impl Trait`,
  and monomorphization.

* Closures: syntax, capturing variables, closure traits, and trait objects.
