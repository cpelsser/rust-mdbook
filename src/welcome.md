# Welcome to Rust 
# (Adapted from Comprehensive Rust) 🦀

The goal of the course is to teach you Rust. We assume you don't know anything
about Rust and aim to:

* Give you a comprehensive understanding of the Rust syntax and language.
* Enable you to modify existing programs
* Write new programs in Rust for embedded systems
* Show interoperability with C

## Assumptions

The course assumes that you already know how to program in C and Python. Rust is a statically
typed language and we will sometimes make comparisons with C (for low-level concepts like
memory management and pointers) and Python (for higher-level concepts like iterators and
error handling) to better explain or contrast the Rust approach.
