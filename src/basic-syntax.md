# Basic Syntax

Much of the Rust syntax will be familiar to you from C, C++ or Java:

* Blocks and scopes are delimited by curly braces.
* Line comments are started with `//`, block comments are delimited by `/* ...
  */`.
* Keywords like `if` and `while` work the same.
* Variable assignment is done with `=`, comparison is done with `==`.

<details>

- Rust uses `let` for variable declarations, not a type name.
- Variables are immutable by default; use `let mut` for mutable variables.
- Rust has strong type inference, so you often don't need type annotations.
- Semicolons are required at the end of statements but not expressions.
