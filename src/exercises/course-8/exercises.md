# Exercises

Time to put it together! In this exercise, you'll combine LEDs and buttons
to create an interactive LED pattern controller.

## Exercise: LED Pattern Controller

[LED Pattern Controller](led-pattern.md)

Build a program that:

1. Displays patterns on the LED matrix
2. Uses buttons to control the display

This exercise practices:

- GPIO output (LEDs)
- GPIO input (buttons)
- State management without heap allocation
- Embedded Rust program structure

**Tips:**

- Start simple - get one pattern working first
- Use arrays to store patterns (they're stack-allocated)
- Test button logic separately before combining with LEDs
