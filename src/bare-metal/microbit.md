# Meet the micro:bit

The [BBC micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) is a small computer designed for
education. Version 2 is perfect for learning embedded Rust because:

- **Built-in peripherals** - LEDs, buttons, sensors with no wiring
- **On-board debugger** - Flash and debug with just a USB cable
- **Great Rust support** - Well-maintained `microbit-v2` crate
- **Affordable** - Around $15-20 USD

This section covers:

- [Hardware Overview](microbit-hardware.md) - What's on the board
- [Development Setup](setup.md) - Installing the toolchain

**Key points:**

- The micro:bit v2 uses a Nordic nRF52833 chip (ARM Cortex-M4)
- No extra hardware (JTAG debugger, wires) needed
- Originally designed for BBC's "Make It Digital" campaign in the UK
